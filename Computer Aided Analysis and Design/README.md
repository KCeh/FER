### Lab assignments<br/>
DZ = Lab<br/>
DZ or Task classes are entry points for program<br/><br/>
Lab 1 - Matrix operations, LU and LUP decomposition, linear system solver<br/>
Lab 2 - Optimization methods: Golden-section search, Coordinate descent, Nelderâ€“Mead method (simplex), Hooke-Jeeves method (Pattern search) <br/>
Lab 3 - Optimization methods: Gradient descent (steepest descent), Newton-Raphson method<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Optimization problems with constraints: Box method, Tranformation in problem without constraints<br/>
Lab 4 - Genetic algorithm with elimination and tournament selection, binary and floating point chromosome<br/>
Lab 5 - TODO<br/><br/>
Note: there is no package structure for assignments due to easy console compile and run requirement
